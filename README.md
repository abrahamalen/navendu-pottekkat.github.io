# Personal Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/88fc42fa-4231-42a5-aac6-40d01f5f2c4c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/navendu/deploys)

Source code of my personal website, [navendu.me](https://navendu.me).

This is meant to be read-only, mostly.

Still, if you like to use this style, I recommend using [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). My website uses a heavily personalized version of PaperMod that might translate poorly for others.
