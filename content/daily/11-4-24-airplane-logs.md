Hello from the sky! I'm writing this from an airplane x feet above the Indian ocean around what I think is Malaysia. I have written a lot of these logs from airports around the world but this is a first.

And this is because of many reasons:

1. I book very cheap international flights which are almost always in the middle of the night and I end up sleeping.
2. Cheap flights are always too full and cramped to be able to write anything good.
3. Reading on flights is very effective as it constraints you to focus on long-form reading which is hard to do in land where there's internet and distractions.

But today's flight from Singapore to Coimbatore is uncharacteristically empty. It might be because they switched the airplane model to an Airbus A321NEO which has more seats than the previous model used in this flight.

I'm also uncharacteristically away from all the loud children and talkative uncles which put me in a clear mind to read some essays. Reading always inspire me to write. And when I thought about it, I'm unlikely to find free time this week to reflect on my time spent at FOSSASIA Summit and Hanoi with me jumping on another flight to Pune for the Kubernetes Community Days tomorrow, so the constraints the metal box in the sky puts me in becomes uncharacteristicly enjoyable.

On a sidethought, I wonder how people with kids generally pick where to sit in flights. Is there data on this? Can I use this data to find optimal seats for my future travels? And what about the seating algorithm used by IRCTC? Can someone who worked on it explain why an eighteen year old me could never find a beautiful girl sitting across me like the movies made me believe? I get it now, eighteen year old boys are always paired with families going on poorly planned trips so that they can convenitently switch me to a seat that is four compartments away.

Bringing my thoughts back to reality and to Hanoi now.

Like last time, the FOSSASIA Summit did a good job in bringing a big enough umbrella to host a variety of communities and projects. There were a lot of familiar faces from last year's event and from other conferences in Asia I went to this last year and spend a lot of time catching up with them.

I also met a lot of new people but there wasn't enough time or energy to continue all those conversations like I wanted to but I'm pretty sure I will run into them some time in the future.

x, the creator of Tor was at the conference. His talk was quite insightful and we kept running into each other in the hallway so I had the opportunity to have some very learning conversations that I will make sure to follow up. Vietnam is an interesting place to talk about privacy and security and the extend to which governments extend their control over its citizens. My understanding of public policy, particularly the aspect of government intervention helped understand similar concepts within Tor.

Tor is primarily funded by the US Government and unsurprisingly my reaction was "wouldn't that defeat the inherent security of the Tor network" with the government being a major stakeholder. I also assumed that the reason the US government would want to fund Tor is only because of this reason. But the reality is that the US Government and its agencies are also one of the top users of Tor. The beauty of this is that the US Government benefits if more users are using Tor. So they are incentivized to leave Tor as it is without government control.

I felt there was a more crypto crowd than last year with I think Etherium being on of the biggest sponsors of the event. I'm wary of crypto and by extension the entire blockchain community solely because I haven't seen any problem that it uniquely solves. I don't think I'm alone here and the pump and dump bros on Twitter aren't helping.

An interesting lens to view the crypto-blockchain landscape is that of altruism. If the community wants to be in the free and open source world, it has to follow the altrusitic nature of open source communities rather than following the capitalistic pyramid schemes.

FOSS United had a booth at the conference and Vishal talked about the FOSS landscape in India and how FOSS United is helping shape it. An excellent point he mentioned during the talk was about the rise of non-FOSS communities in India. While he didn't mention any names it was obviously refering to the Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta led developer and student groups.

I think it is absolutely fine to use the products offered by these technologies and I'm not condeming their community initiatives as they have helped foster the culture around communities and software for years but it inadvertently puts FOSS commuinties and projects at a disadvantage.

FOSS communitiies are usually volunteer driven and usually operate on minimum or no funds while these other communities have access to big tech wallets and their resources. Recognizing this issue is itself a right step forward and communities like FOSS United are encouraging more FOSS communities to grow in even the smaller cities in the country.

FOSSASIA Summit is and will continue to be one of the best tech conferences in the world. However, one trend I noticed that might cause this train to derail is the proliferation of sponsored speaking slots.

I understand that conferences will have marketing. Even I plug Apache APISIX in my talks (although it is open source) and that helps us get customers and in turn help me travel the world and talk to people about open source. But, throwing an exorbant amount of money and effectively hijacking the conference can quickly be problematic.

In any case, I found most of the sales pitch talks from the conference uninteresting and skipped them for quality conversations in the hallway.

Although I have been to Vietnam before, this was my first time in Hanoi. I spent the weekend exploring the city by foot and by mouth.

The conference had enough social events to unwind and talk about different things that tech even though these conversations invariably ended up in tech or tech policy.

I stuck to my word and had a lot of beer.

We had planned a trip to Ha Long Bay before but because I was alone in this trip, I decided to skip it for another time. Vietnam is growing on me and at least five people have offered to host and take me around when I'm in Hanoi next time. So another return to Vietnam feels more and more inevitable.

A friend from Thailand also showed me some photos from his sabbatical spent in rural Thailand and that has sowed a new seed in by brain about backpacking across south east Asia with a backpack full of clothes and a laptop. Doing this in 2024 seems highly unlikely unless I'm there for work.

I look through my window and see nothing but the darkness of the sky and the ocean beneath. I stare into the darkness and pause for a while before I try to stimulate my brain with a sci-fi novel on my kindle.
